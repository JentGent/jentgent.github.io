When I was 7, my brother introduced me to <a href="https://khanacademy.org" target="_blank">Khan Academy</a>'s <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming" target="_blank">computer programming</a> section. I spent my days <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/rodeo-stampede-3d/5218478237696000" target="_blank">recreating little mobile games</a>, <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/i-tried-laggy/6296798829166592" target="_blank">posting my coding experiments</a>, and getting banned for participating in community discussions (I was underage).

That same passion for programming still guides me now---along with a much more comprehensive understanding of math and logic. I like coding minigames, simulations, and whatever else sparks my motivation.

Thanks for visiting my website!
